      "Corinne Olympios looked more than willing and fully conscious when she led DeMario Jackson into a pool as they started to hookup while shooting \"Bachelor in Paradise.\"A scene that appears to be part of the controversial incident -- where Corinne essentially claimed sexual assault because she says she was not conscious -- was teased Monday night during the 'Bachelorette' finale. It shows Corinne leading DeMario into the pool in the daylight, with some of her fellow cast members close by ... and cameras rolling.It seems Corinne's speaking coherently and looks very with it ... much like we reported. It's unclear, though, how much time passed between this pool scene and the alleged sexual misconduct. Her legal team says the footage that alarmed a 'BiP' producer -- which eventually shut down production -- took place in a hot tub, not the pool.We've confirmed that's accurate, and Warner Bros. says that hot tub footage will not be aired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corinne Olympios was popping pills and mixing booze during \"Bachelor in Paradise\" filming before the infamous swimming pool hookup with DeMario Jackson ... TMZ has learned.Sources close to production tell TMZ ... Corinne made the admission during Saturday's taping of the 'BiP' reunion. We're told she didn't elaborate on what kind of Rx, but she's adamant -- ingesting the pills that day and mixing it with booze intensified her drunkenness, which she says led to her blacking out.TMZ broke the story ... production shut down following allegations of sexual misconduct in a pool. A producer felt Corinne was incapable of giving consent, but the video and interviews with various members of cast and crew led Warner Bros. honchos to conclude ... she knew what she was doing.It's interesting ... when 'BiP' filming resumed, new policies were implemented, such as checking bags for prescription drugs, legal or otherwise. Now it makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bachelor In Paradise\" is hyping a one-on-one showdown between Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, but it will actually be more like Michael Phelps' race against a great white shark.Sources close to production tell us Corinne and DeMario did NOT come face-to-face when the reunion show taped Saturday. While promoting the show, host Chris Harrison has said he'll be talking with both of them together ... insinuating he'd be mediating/refereeing.While fans would eat that up ... it ain't gonna happen. We're told DeMario came out for a solo sit-down with Harrison, but left before Corinne did her one-on-one. We're told neither were briefed on plans to be onstage at the same time.Our DeMario sources tell us he's no longer interested in seeing Corinne face-to-face to hash out the aftermath from their pool sex encounter -- mostly because he doesn't think she would be genuine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turns out controversial \"Bachelor In Paradise\" star DeMario Jackson may not be done with reality TV -- TMZ has learned producers are seriously considering him for a \"Dancing With the Stars\" slot.Sources close to production tell us the show reached out to DeMario's publicist weeks ago, which explains why he was already fully campaigning to be in the ballroom when we asked about it last week.We're told nothing's signed ... they're still negotiating, but hard to imagine a scenario where DeMario doesn't take this opportunity.DeMario didn't return to the 'BiP' set in Mexico following the oral sex controversy with Corinne Olympios that shut down production, but he will be on the reunion episode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robby Hayes and Amanda Stanton are now a thing, thanks to \"Bachelor in Paradise.\" Oh, and ... spoiler alert.Amanda and Robby were hand-in-hand for a weekend stroll in WeHo. We're not judging, but seems like they're already coordinating their wardrobes (Ok, we're judging).They were both down in Mexico shooting the upcoming 'BiP' season ... and maybe the third time will be the charm for Amanda. She finished fourth on Ben Higgins' 'Bachelor' season, and was briefly engaged to Josh Murray before calling it off in December 2016.Robby was the runner-up on JoJo Fletcher's season.If at first you don't succeed ... get recast!\n",
      "\n",
      "Corinne Olympios could come face-to-face with DeMario Jackson on the \"Bachelor in Paradise\" reunion show, 'cause she'll be there ... according to Corinne herself.Corinne put out a statement Wednesday, saying, \"I am very happy to be appearing on the Bachelor In Paradise Special\" which her rep confirmed was, in fact, the reunion show that'll take place in the near future ... seeing how filming has wrapped.We broke the story ... DeMario -- who was at the center of the sex scandal on the show with Corinne -- will also be at the 'BiP' renuion show ... and he wants to settle things with Corinne once and for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bachelor in Paradise\" has a new way of reeling in viewers ... tapping into the sex scandal that temporarily shipwrecked the show.Production sources tell TMZ, host Chris Harrison held a powwow with the cast on the first day back to film the show after the Warner Bros. probe concluded there was no sexual assault ... and the cameras were rolling as he took people back to the Corinne Olympios/DeMario Jackson sexual escapade in the pool.We're told Harrison dramatically recounted how a producer expressed concerns and it turned into a full blown scandal. After taking everyone through the investigation, he paused, then asked the cast if they were comfortable continuing, and gave them a chance to pack up and leave.To absolutely no one's surprise, everyone stayed, drank and even banged in the boom boom room.Lemonade ... it comes from lemons.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeMario Jackson is not only willing ... he's eager to appear on a \"Bachelor in Paradise\" reunion show so he can hug all his former castmates who privately supported him over Corinne Olympios' sexual assault allegations.DeMario was at Toast in L.A. Saturday and he clearly holds no grudges.  Listen to him describe his feelings for Corinne ... this after she came on strong that she did not have the capacity to consent to a sexual escapade with DeMario in a swimming pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lexi Thexton﻿'s message to DeMario Jackson ﻿for ditching her to go on \"The Bachelorette?\" -- the pose says it all ... ya assed out on getting this!!!Lexi showed off her buns in a pink bikini in Santa Monica ... and she's as hot as the sand.You'll recall Rachel Lindsay infamously booted DeMario when Lexi made a surprise 'Bachelorette' appearance to confront him for going on the show even though, according to her, they were still an item.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeMario Jackson doesn't care that some people think he committed sexual assault on \"Bachelor in Paradise\" -- despite being cleared -- and he seems to target the haters as racists from Oklahoma.DeMario was at a WeHo spa this week, when he told our photog he has no regrets over doing the show. He says he met some great people, although we're guessing one of them is not Corinne Olympios.It's unclear why he's got such a thing against Oklahoma. Hated the musical?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bachelor in Paradise\" star Amanda Stanton just finished shooting the show, and she says the new rules didn't really get in the way when it came to hooking up.Amanda flew into John Wayne Airport from Mexico Wednesday and told our photog she followed the new rules in the wake of the Corinne/DeMario fiasco ... namely, making it clear sex is consensual.She also adhered to the 2 drink per hour rule, although it sounds like Amanda believes 2 drinks were required!\n",
      "\n",
      "Corinne Olympios is satisfied with her legal team's investigation into the \"Bachelor in Paradise\" pool incident with DeMario Jackson.Corinne says, \"I felt victimized by the fact that others were judging me through conflicting and unsubstantiated reports, while I myself had no recollection of the events that transpired. My team’s investigation into this matter has now been completed to my satisfaction.\"As we reported, Corinne hired Marty Singer to represent her. After Warner Bros. announced its investigation revealed no wrongdoing on DeMario's part, Singer said he would continue looking into what happened when Corinne and DeMario had a drunken hookup in the pool.Corinne adds, \"My intent over the past few weeks has been to learn and understand what happened on June 4. While I never filed complaints or accusations against anyone associated with Bachelor in Paradise, my team and I felt it was very important to be thorough in getting to the bottom of what had occurred.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The cast of \"Bachelor in Paradise\" now has a VERY close relationship with the crew under the show's new rules. The question is, business as usual, or the new normal?Contestants were hanging poolside at the Mexican resort where 'BiP' resumed filming after the DeMario Jackson/Corinne Olympios sex scandal. It's plain as day .. cameramen and producers are hovering like flies over their stars.We broke the stories ... 'BiP' showrunners have implemented strict new rules for the cast, including a 2 drink maximum per hour, a sweep for illegal drugs ... and having to get permission from producers before hooking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeMario Jackson doesn't need the 'Bachelor' franchise to help him wrangle hot chicks ... dude's leaving the club with car loads of them post his and Corinne's \"Bachelor in Paradise\" mess.Corinne didn't get an invite back to the show, which is back in production, but DeMario has said he's done with it forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bachelor in Paradise\" contestants who want to have sex must wait a beat and get permission from producers ... TMZ has learned.Sources at the Mexican resort where the show is being filmed tell TMZ there are new rules in place regarding sex ... especially in \"The Boom Boom Room\" -- where most indoor sex goes down.We're told before anyone can get it on, both parties must go to a producer and state that they consent. If the producer feels either party is incapable of giving consent, the producer can pull the plug.We're told when contestants arrived over the weekend, they sat through a 2-hour meeting with lawyers and others who ran through all the rules.And get this ... if contestants violate the rule and go right into \"The Boom Boom Room,\" producers can barge in and stop things mid-coitus.TMZ broke the story ... Warner Bros. implemented new rules as part of the show's reboot, including handing over all drugs -- legal or not -- and a 2-drink maximum per hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bachelor in Paradise\" producers aren't taking any chances of drunken, nonconsensual sex ... because they've imposed new drinking rules on the cast.Production sources tell us there is now a 2 drink max per hour. We're told the crew is monitoring drinking levels among the cast and the bartenders are also responsible for keeping tabs.Producers have also made a point of providing food at all times during the shoots ... presumably to absorb the alcohol.We're told the cast got a talkin' to over the whole Corinne/DeMario situation, both on and off camera, and drinking was a big talking point.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeMario Jackson is looking for answers, and thinks a 1-on-1 with Corinne Olympios could help him finally get some peace of mind ... but she's gotta make the first move.Sources close to the \"Bachelor in Paradise\" outcast tell TMZ ... he wants to chat with Corinne about her sexual assault claim. DeMario's telling friends he doesn't hold a grudge -- after being cleared by Warner Bros. -- especially since he's bound to see Corinne again with other 'Bachelor' alums.We're told DeMario was \"blindsided and confused\" when he heard she claimed to be a victim, because when they got sent home producers told him it was because a third party had a problem with their pool sexcapade -- not Corinne.DeMario assumed he and Corinne would move on and be friends since they got along so well the first day filming -- laughing, chatting and hooking up -- so he doesn't understand what changed.There's a catch -- we're also told DeMario's not going to reach out to Corinne. He feels the ball's in her court since she played the victim card ... but he'll drop everything to meet with her if she calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeMario Jackson's livin' easy now that Warner Bros. cleared him of sexual assault on \"Bachelor in Paradise\" ... and the handful of hot women with him probably helps too.DeMario hit up Avenue in L.A. for a night out with several ladies Friday night. He didn't answer any questions ... but his smile said a lot. Questionable t-shirt choice though.We broke the story ... Warner Bros. concluded their investigation of Jackson's 'BiP' scandal with Corinne Olympios and found no sexual assault occurred. Still, DeMario says he won't return to the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bachelor in Paradise\" contestants will have to ante up all drugs -- both legal and not -- when they land in Mexico for the relaunched version this weekend.TMZ has obtained an email sent by producers to contestants, which informs them of some of the \"new procedures\" that have been initiated in the wake of the Corinne Olympios/DeMario Jackson scandal.The email reads in part, \"Upon your arrival, your bags will be inventoried specifically for any over the counter and prescription drugs that are not prescribed to you.\" Any prescription/illegal drugs will be confiscated.\"The email goes on ... \"All drugs, over the counter and prescribed, must be submitted to the Nurse to keep and dispense accordingly for your stay in Mexico.\"Our production sources say the drug policy is NOT related to Corinne's claim she blacked out during a sexual encounter with DeMario in a swimming pool. We broke the story, Warner Bros. investigated and after reviewing the video concluded she was alert and fully engaged throughout. There is no evidence she was on drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former \"Bachelor\" contestant AshLee Frazier thinks nothing untoward happened between Corinne and DeMario on \"Bachelor in Paradise\" and strongly believes they should come back and hook up.We got the Season 17 alum at LAX Friday, and she thinks the whole sexual assault thing was made up by a disgruntled producer. TMZ broke the story ... Warner Bros. conducted an investigation and determined Corinne was alert and fully engaged when she engaged in oral sex with DeMario in a pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeMario Jackson -- the guy who had oral sex with Corinne Olympios during filming of \"Bachelor in Paradise\" -- is done with the show.Sources close to DeMario tell TMZ he's suffered from anxiety over the scandal after living under a cloud of suspicion for a week. He's even started seeing a therapist. And, he's upset because his name will now forever be linked to a sex scandal, even though Warner Bros. essentially concluded he did nothing wrong.We're told DeMario claims producers spoke to his lawyer and invited him back on the show, but he's done. Other sources dispute that he was invited back and say no decision has been made.We're told DeMario now wants to ditch reality TV for a career as an on-air personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corinne Olympios' boyfriend does not believe she cheated on him, does not believe the Warner Bros. investigation was kosher, and will not dump her.Jordan Gielchinsky has made it clear to friends ... he still believes Corinne that she was in a blackout state when she had oral sex with DeMario Jackson in a swimming pool during the first day of 'BIP' filming.Jordan claims he has spoken to several cast members who back up her story, and he thinks the Warner Bros. investigation was a whitewash so the show could resume filming.As we reported, multiple people who have seen the video say Corinne seemed fully engaged in the pool and at no time does she seem out of it.We're told Corinne made a deal with Jordan ... she wouldn't have sex with anyone on the show. He thinks the swimming pool incident doesn't count because she was drunk out of her mind.Jordan's also suspicious because he says Corinne's lawyer has not been able to see the tape but it was shown to DeMario's attorney.

Our own investigation will continue based on multiple new witnesses coming forward revealing what they saw and heard.”Singer also points out ... it was one of the show's own producers who thought something was improper on set -- “It needs to be made crystal clear that production of 'Bachelor in Paradise' was shut down because of multiple complaints received from 'BIP' producers and crew members on the set. It was not shut down due to any complaint filed by Corinne against anyone.\"Corinne has yet to say IF she's suing, and if so ... who she'd sue.

As we reported, multiple people who saw the video claim Corinne was \"fully engaged\" and lucid throughout the sexual encounter.We're told the investigation is now complete and the finding was there was no sexual assault.We're told DeMario's lawyer met with Warner Bros. lawyers Monday, reviewed the tapes and assured him he was in the clear.Our sources say filming will resume in the same location in Mexico.

Her plan was to be on for a couple episodes, and then bow out.Of course, that plan went to crap on the first day of taping when DeMario Jackson and Corinne ended up \"rubbing, touching and fingering\" in the pool.

As for what type of music ... rap, \"poetry music\" and traditional singing.The catalyst was the Yo Gotti music video shoot down in Miami a couple weeks back with Nicki, who Chyna sees as a mentor. The next step is to get signed.We're told Chyna's lined up several meetings with record labels in L.A., and already met bigwigs at Capital Records.The good news for Rob ...

If that changes though, Rob would likely be the one asking for a couple of reasons.First, Rob has Dream more often than Chyna -- we're told that's always been the case. Second, she makes way more money than he does. We're told Rob banks very little on his own outside of the family reality show. Chyna, on the other hand, makes huge chunks of change on appearances and hosting gigs.So, even if custody ends up being a 50/50 split ... there's at least the possibility Rob could eventually go after her for support.

Tyga's baby mama. He says the overlapping relationships did NOT create an awkward situation, but he also knew Rob couldn't handle Chyna -- for a bunch of reasons.On the biz side ... the rapper says he had to pay a million dollars to end his contract with Cash Money -- but also claims his old label still owes him $12 mil.\n",

Contracts have been circulated but not signed, and the unresolved issue is money. We're told he feels the show is lowballing him.Production sources say producers are into Ferrari's brashness ... specifically that he is unashamed and will go toe-to-toe with anybody.

We're told  Chyna's hired 4 extra bodyguards for the night in case the rapper -- who hails from ATL -- shows up.Chyna's camp claims Ferrari's been calling and texting her the past week, and demands for him to stop the harassment having been blown off. We're told Chyna believes he's released revenge porn despite a letter warning him not to, and she also fears for her safety because he's acting obsessive and delusional. His interview with TMZ particularly scared her.The owner of Medusa, Lil Henny, tells us he will honor Chyna's ban request and make sure Ferrari is not allowed on the premises while she's working the joint.\n",

The club's also throwing in 3 bottles of rose.The timing is no coincidence ... we're told Chyna's the one who pitched the idea to AOD and they were all for it.If you recall, that's how she made a huge chunk of her change back in the day, so looks like she's back to her old party tricks and sending a message she doesn't need Rob ... although she might need him to watch Dream that night.\n",

      "Rob Kardashian may be guilty of revenge porn, but he says Blac Chyna is trying to get her own revenge ... in the jewelry department, so claim sources connected to Rob.Our Kardashian sources say a few days before Rob went off Friday by slut shaming Chyna, he was courting her with bling. They say a jeweler came to Chyna's house with 7 pieces of jewelry, worth a total of $250k. Rob wanted Chyna to pick one as a gift from him.The jeweler decided to leave all 7 so Chyna could mull it over. Then Rob went crazy, and our Kardashian sources say she only returned 3 pieces, keeping a ring and 3 tennis bracelets ... worth around $125k. We're told Chyna tried charging a significant amount on Rob's card for some of the jewelry, but it was flagged and denied by Rob's business manager.We're told the jeweler has contacted Chyna several times, telling her the gift was off the table and asking her to return all of the items, but it's fallen on deaf ears.To add insult to injury, Chyna wore the 3 tennis bracelets to court Monday when she got a restraining order against Rob.Chyna begs to differ. Celebrity lawyer Lisa Bloom, who reps Chyna, tells us Rob outright gave her all 7 pieces as a gift so she had no obligation to return anything. Bloom says after Rob's tirade, Chyna decided to return 4 items but kept the tennis bracelet set because she liked them and as she saw it returning 4 items that were legally hers was a gift to Rob.It's now the Wimbledon of jewelry disputes.   A rep for Rob declined to comment.\n",

He doesn't think it's consistent with her character, and she wouldn't do that to him ... if it was up to her.Seems hypocritical of Ferrari, since, as we first reported ... he got cold feet, and returned $135k worth of jewelry he'd bought for her. It's strange that he'd expect her to have compassion for him after that.\n",

He said he regrets he didn't deal with the Chyna drama privately and said it wouldn't happen again.One thing Rob did not apologize for ... he flatly denied he ever physically abused Chyna.Rob also acknowledged all of the Kardashian women warned him Chyna was \"bad news\" and he should stay away ... advice he ignored. He told them they were right.He also said he stayed with Chyna longer than he should have because he grew up in a 2-parent household and wanted the same for Dream.We're told Rob and family have stayed quiet through the ordeal in an effort to stop the back and forth in the best interest of his daughter.We're told the women accepted his apology and are hopeful he'll heed their advice.\n",

Bloom says, \"Posting online or distributing photos of Ms. White's intimate body parts is a crime punishable by fines and jail time.\"And for good measure ... she also brought up California's revenge porn law.

We're told the arrangement has been \"loose by consent\" and recently Rob has had the kid 4 days a week and Blac Chyna picks up the remaining 3. The staff of nannys/baby nurses are always present.Our sources say they have had no problem on co-parenting, which includes child-rearing decisions. Somehow they have been able to wall off their personal beef.We're also told Rob and Blac Chyna have no plan to go to court and ask a judge to make a formal child custody order, although we are told they will probably memorialize the arrangement in writing.BTW ... during Monday's hearing, when Chyna got a restraining order against Rob, he had the kid.\n",

She says she ran to her bedroom and he broke the door open. She supposedly has photos and videos of the incident.As for Rob, sources close to the situation say in December, the day Chyna moved out of the house she and Rob were sharing, she tried choking him with an iPhone cord and tried hitting him with a metal rod. The sources say Corey Gamble walked in and pulled Chyna off Rob. She then allegedly went through the house, smashing televisions, doors and other items, causing $35k in damage. The sources say Rob has surveillance video documenting the incident.We're also told Rob's lawyers have texts from the time Chyna moved out, in which she told a friend that Rob would never hit her.

As we reported, Chyna says Rob got physical with her back in April.We're told Shapiro's main reason for showing up on Rob's behalf is to discuss custody arrangements involving Dream.Our sources say Shapiro will attempt to assure the judge Rob will not post intimate pics of Chyna, nor will he post her medical or other personal information.

      "Top 5 articles similar to Article #100: \"Bachelor In Paradise\" is hyping a one-on-one showdown between Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, but it will actually be more like Michael Phelps' race against a great white shark.Sources close to production tell us Corinne and DeMario did NOT come face-to-face when the reunion show taped Saturday. While promoting the show, host Chris Harrison has said he'll be talking with both of them together ... insinuating he'd be mediating/refereeing.While fans would eat that up ... it ain't gonna happen. We're told DeMario came out for a solo sit-down with Harrison, but left before Corinne did her one-on-one. We're told neither were briefed on plans to be onstage at the same time.Our DeMario sources tell us he's no longer interested in seeing Corinne face-to-face to hash out the aftermath from their pool sex encounter -- mostly because he doesn't think she would be genuine. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #1 Turns out controversial \"Bachelor In Paradise\" star DeMario Jackson may not be done with reality TV -- TMZ has learned producers are seriously considering him for a \"Dancing With the Stars\" slot.Sources close to production tell us the show reached out to DeMario's publicist weeks ago, which explains why he was already fully campaigning to be in the ballroom when we asked about it last week.We're told nothing's signed ... they're still negotiating, but hard to imagine a scenario where DeMario doesn't take this opportunity.DeMario didn't return to the 'BiP' set in Mexico following the oral sex controversy with Corinne Olympios that shut down production, but he will be on the reunion episode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #2 \"Bachelor in Paradise\" has a new way of reeling in viewers ... tapping into the sex scandal that temporarily shipwrecked the show.Production sources tell TMZ, host Chris Harrison held a powwow with the cast on the first day back to film the show after the Warner Bros. probe concluded there was no sexual assault ... and the cameras were rolling as he took people back to the Corinne Olympios/DeMario Jackson sexual escapade in the pool.We're told Harrison dramatically recounted how a producer expressed concerns and it turned into a full blown scandal. After taking everyone through the investigation, he paused, then asked the cast if they were comfortable continuing, and gave them a chance to pack up and leave.To absolutely no one's surprise, everyone stayed, drank and even banged in the boom boom room.Lemonade ... it comes from lemons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #3 DeMario Jackson is looking for answers, and thinks a 1-on-1 with Corinne Olympios could help him finally get some peace of mind ... but she's gotta make the first move.Sources close to the \"Bachelor in Paradise\" outcast tell TMZ ... he wants to chat with Corinne about her sexual assault claim. DeMario's telling friends he doesn't hold a grudge -- after being cleared by Warner Bros. -- especially since he's bound to see Corinne again with other 'Bachelor' alums.We're told DeMario was \"blindsided and confused\" when he heard she claimed to be a victim, because when they got sent home producers told him it was because a third party had a problem with their pool sexcapade -- not Corinne.DeMario assumed he and Corinne would move on and be friends since they got along so well the first day filming -- laughing, chatting and hooking up -- so he doesn't understand what changed.There's a catch -- we're also told DeMario's not going to reach out to Corinne. He feels the ball's in her court since she played the victim card ... but he'll drop everything to meet with her if she calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #4 Corinne Olympios' boyfriend knew exactly what he was signing up for when she decided to go on \"Bachelor in Paradise\" ... with one HUGE caveat.Sources close to the couple tell TMZ ... Corinne and her BF, Jordan Gielchinsky, agreed she would NOT hook up with other cast members, and was only going to do the show to get pub for her new clothing line. Her plan was to be on for a couple episodes, and then bow out.Of course, that plan went to crap on the first day of taping when DeMario Jackson and Corinne ended up \"rubbing, touching and fingering\" in the pool. We broke the story ... Warner Bros. shut down production, launched an investigation and sent the cast home.We're told Jordan was initially upset when he heard what went down, but once he got the full context of the event -- meaning the heavy drinking -- he backed Corinne. He agrees she was way too drunk to give consent, and strongly believes producers and medical staffers should have intervened.The couple's been inseparable in L.A. since she returned from Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #5 Production for 'Bachelor in Paradise' has been suspended after allegations of misconduct were reported ... which puts a halt to filming for the upcoming season indefinitely.Warner Bros. execs for the show said Sunday that they had been alerted to some sort of misconduct on the set of 'BiP', which is currently shooting in Mexico.As a result of the allegations -- which at this point have not been made public -- WB has put a temporary halt to the show and is now investigating. They've said they will also take appropriate action upon completing the investigation.This season of 'BiP' is highly anticipated, especially after Nick Viall's recent stint on 'The Bachelor.' Some of his axed ladies like Raven Gates, Corinne Olympios and Taylor Nolan were cast, as was Amanda Stanton from Ben Higgins' season. Some of the guys cast were Derek Peth, Nick Benvenutti, Ben Zorn and DeMario Jackson.\n",

      "Top 5 articles similar to Article #22: Blac Chyna had the cops called on her after Rob's baby mama went ham over a roofer.It happened Tuesday morning at Chyna's L.A. home. She pitched a fit when a guy next door started pitching a roof at 9 AM. We're told Chyna confronted the homeowner, saying it was too damn early to start construction. She said the noise woke up little Dream, and that pissed her off.The neighbor claims Chyna went so ballistic she got scared and called the cops.We're told cops showed up and gave Chyna a free lesson about the law. In L.A., construction can fire up at 7 AM, so the roofer was well within his rights.Chyna calmed down, and cops beat it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #1 Rob Kardashian's revenge against Blac Chyna -- posting pics of her vagina and breasts -- would seem to violate the revenge porn law ... but that doesn't seem to be the case.As we reported, Rob believed Chyna was cheating on him and he went on the warpath, not only posting the pics but after they were removed ... he reposted them.In California there's a 2013 law which states ... \"A person who intentionally distributes the image of the intimate body part of another ... knowing they'll cause emotional distress\" is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to 6 months in jail.You would think it's a textbook case of revenge porn, but there's a rub. Chyna \"liked\" the pics on Instagram, so it's hard to argue she suffered emotional distress.What's more ... the law says in order to be convicted there must have been an understanding the images would remain private. \"Liking\" the pics does not seem consistent with keeping the pics private.And one more thing ... we're told the would-be victim -- Blac Chyna -- would never go to the cops and file a police report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #2 Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna are making new allegations of domestic violence against each other, and both claim the alleged incidents are captured on video.Chyna -- who's in court Monday morning for a domestic violence restraining order against Rob -- has already claimed Rob got physical with her.Sources connected with Chyna tell us she will add other claims, including one incident several months ago where she says Rob allegedly hit her and knocked her to the ground. She says she ran to her bedroom and he broke the door open. She supposedly has photos and videos of the incident.As for Rob, sources close to the situation say in December, the day Chyna moved out of the house she and Rob were sharing, she tried choking him with an iPhone cord and tried hitting him with a metal rod. The sources say Corey Gamble walked in and pulled Chyna off Rob. She then allegedly went through the house, smashing televisions, doors and other items, causing $35k in damage. The sources say Rob has surveillance video documenting the incident.We're also told Rob's lawyers have texts from the time Chyna moved out, in which she told a friend that Rob would never hit her. Our sources say they feel the messages help to vindicate Rob.\n",

      "Recommendation #3 Rob Kardashian's brutal rants against Blac Chyna showed her side piece the light -- and now Ferrari is kicking her to the curb too, and saving himself more than 100 grand in the process.Sources connected to the rapper, tell us Ferrari was hooked on Chyna ... so much so he dropped $135,648 on three pieces of jewelry for her:- $34,850 for a Rolex - $56,500 for a gold necklace- $32,250 for diamond earringsFerrari scooped up the booty back in June when he thought he and Chyna were the real deal -- she's even listed as \"spouse\" on the receipt. We're told they'd talked for a while about getting his and hers Rollies -- but after Rob accused BC of banging several dudes, Ferrari was done.We're told his manager, Keely the Boss, planned to deliver the gifts on July 5, but that's the day Rob unleashed his allegations. Ferrari immediately called off the delivery and returned everything on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #4 Blac Chyna's beefing up her personal security and got her former side piece banned from her upcoming club appearance ... because his recent actions are scaring her.Sources close to Chyna tell TMZ ... Ferrari won't be allowed in at the Medusa Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta Saturday night, where Blac is scheduled to host a party. We're told  Chyna's hired 4 extra bodyguards for the night in case the rapper -- who hails from ATL -- shows up.Chyna's camp claims Ferrari's been calling and texting her the past week, and demands for him to stop the harassment having been blown off. We're told Chyna believes he's released revenge porn despite a letter warning him not to, and she also fears for her safety because he's acting obsessive and delusional. His interview with TMZ particularly scared her.The owner of Medusa, Lil Henny, tells us he will honor Chyna's ban request and make sure Ferrari is not allowed on the premises while she's working the joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation #5 Rob Kardashian is deeply remorseful for slut shaming Blac Chyna ... at least that's what he told his family.Sources close to the situation tell TMZ ... Rob's spoken with all of his sisters and his mom, telling them he has no excuse for posting nude pics of Chyna and her medical information on social media. He said he regrets he didn't deal with the Chyna drama privately and said it wouldn't happen again.One thing Rob did not apologize for ... he flatly denied he ever physically abused Chyna.Rob also acknowledged all of the Kardashian women warned him Chyna was \"bad news\" and he should stay away ... advice he ignored. He told them they were right.He also said he stayed with Chyna longer than he should have because he grew up in a 2-parent household and wanted the same for Dream.We're told Rob and family have stayed quiet through the ordeal in an effort to stop the back and forth in the best interest of his daughter.We're told the women accepted his apology and are hopeful he'll heed their advice.\n",
