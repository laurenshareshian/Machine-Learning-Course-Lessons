    "### Independence\n",
    "Two events are independent if the occurrence of one has no effect at all on the probability of the other. If two events are independent, then $P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) P(B)$. For example, since the toss of a die is independent from the next toss, then the probability of getting a 1 on my first toss and a 5 on my second toss is $(1/6)*(1/6)=1/36$. In contrast, if I draw two cards from a deck without replacement, then these two events are dependent and thus I cannot say that the probability of getting a queen on my first and second draw is $(4/52)*(4/52)$ since it is actually $(4/52)*(3/51)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes Rule\n",
    "Bayes rule provides us with a way to update our beliefs based on the arrival of new, relevant pieces of evidence. For example, if we were trying to provide the probability that a given person has cancer, we would initially just say it is whatever percent of the population has cancer. However, given additional evidence such as the fact that the person is a smoker, we can update our probability, since the probability of having cancer is higher given that the person is a smoker. This allows us to utilize prior knowledge to improve our probability estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayes Rule** states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule has a very simple derivation that directly leads from the relationship between joint and conditional probabilities. First, note that $P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A|B)P(B)$ and $P( A\\text{ and } B) = P(B|A)P(A)$. Setting these equal to each other and rearranging gives us Bayes rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, A is the event we want the probability of, and B is the new evidence that is related to A in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) is called the **posterior**; this is what we are trying to estimate. In the above example, this would be the “probability of having cancer given that the person is a smoker”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) is called the **likelihood**; this is the probability of observing the new evidence, given our initial hypothesis. In the above example, this would be the “probability of being a smoker given that the person has cancer”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A) is called the **prior**; this is the probability of our hypothesis without any additional prior information. In the above example, this would be the “probability of having cancer”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) is called the **marginal likelihood**; this is the total probability of observing the evidence. In the above example, this would be the “probability of being a smoker”. In many applications of Bayes Rule, this is ignored, as it mainly serves as normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes Example\n",
    "Using the cancer diagnosis example, we can show that Bayes rule allows us to obtain a much better estimate. Now, we will put some made-up numbers into the example so we can assess the difference that Bayes rule made. Assume that the probability of having cancer is 0.05 — meaning that 5% of people have cancer. Now, assume that the probability of being a smoker is 0.10 — meaning that 10% of people are smokers, and that 20% of people with cancer are smokers, so P(smoker|cancer) = 0.20. Initially, our probability for cancer is simply our prior, so 0.05. However, using new evidence, we can instead calculate P(cancer|smoke), which is equal to (P(smoker|cancer) * P(cancer)) / P(smoker) = (0.20 * 0.05) / (0.10) = 0.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing new evidence, we therefore obtained a better probability estimation. Initially we had a probability of 0.05, but using the smoker evidence, we were able to get to a more accurate probability that was double our prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. Since we assume each feature is independent from each other, this is why it is called \"naive\".\n",
