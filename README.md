I will be teaching a semester-long machine learning elective honors course for the first time at Oregon Episcopal School in the fall of 2019 and I will post course materials as I write them. Some resources that I plan on drawing heavily from include:

- [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
- [Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
- [Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/pages/book.html)
- [Machine Learning For Hackers by Drew Conway & John White](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018483.do)
- [Life is Linear by Tim Chartier for the linear algebra projects unit](https://www.maa.org/press/books/when-life-is-linear-from-computer-graphics-to-bracketology)

Some websites that I always find helpful - besides Stack Overflow obviously :) - are:
- [scikit-learn docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/)
- [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/)
